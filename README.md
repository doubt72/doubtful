A toy language interpreter.  The third-most pointless thing I've ever done.

## Why This?

I was reading papers on compiler design, and uh, this happened.  Although it's
just a stinking interpreter, I might still try to link it to LLVM or something.
We'll see.

In the meantime, I have learned some interesting things about how languages
work.  I also wrote a lot of crappy code that really needs to be heavily
refactored.  Because...

This is also the first program I ever wrote in Rust.  Still haven't quite
mastered Rust.  Seems fast, but it's got some awkward bits.

Go look at the random [notes I wrote](spec.txt) (sort of a spec, sort of
up-to-date).
